# Graph-Algorithms
## A series of graph algorithms I implemented in order to undestand the inner works of them

1.  Print the number of vertices.
2.  Parse the set of vertices.
3.  Check if between two vertices is an edge or not.
4.  Get the IN degree and the OUT degree of a vertex.
5.  Get the set of OUT-bound edges of a specified vertex.
6.  Get the set of IN-bound edges of a specified vertex.
7.  Get the cost of an edge.
8.  Change the cost of an edge.
9.  Add a new edge.
10. Remove an edge.
11. Add a new vertex.
12. Remove a vertex.
13. Create a new copy.
14. Overwrite the main graph
15. Find the connected components (Breath First Traversal)
16. Find the shortest path between two vertices (Reverse Dijkstra Algorithm - must be DIRECTED)
17. Find the minimum spanning tree (Prim's Algorithm - must be UNDIRECTED)
18. Find a Hamiltonian cycle of no more than twice the minimum cost
